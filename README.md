# BU_Offcampus_Guide
The BU Off-Campus Guide acts as an informative and useful medium for students (currently limited to the Binghamton students) trying to know more about off-campus housing and stay in Binghamton. Our aim is to provide an interactive website for quick access to information that the students need while in Binghamton, without much hassle and wasting time in browsing through multiple websites.
